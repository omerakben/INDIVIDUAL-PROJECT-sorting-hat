# Sorting Hat

## Overview
This project brings the Hogwarts sorting hat to life! As a developer, I'm following the provided instructions to create an interactive web application. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, with a focus on JavaScript functions and methods. Users can input a student's name, and the app will assign them to a random Hogwarts house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin). Additional features include sorting students alphabetically by name or by house.
